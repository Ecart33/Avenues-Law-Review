However, the most revolutionizing of all recent technologies is the advent and widespread adoption of cell phones. The powerful benefits of these technologies also come with very serious concerns at many levels. One of the most pervasive issues is the newfound power of the government to infringe upon individuals\u2019 privacy rights and violate their Fourth Amendment at an unprecedented scale by utilizing various tracking technologies that most civilians are completely unaware of. Carpenter v. United States is a landmark case for defining the limits of unwarranted government surveillance in the context of modern technology, which has become so ingrained in our daily life that society would not function without it. Carpenter v. United States has cemented some basic privacy rights and acts as a declaration from the Supreme Court that intimately personal features of modern technology are a protected right.", ""], ["        A federal jury convicted Carpenter of with \u201csix counts including aiding and abetting robbery that affected interstate commerce\u2014a violation of the Hobbs Act\u2014and aiding and abetting the use or carriage of a firearm during a federal crime of violence\u201d[3]", "[3] Electronic Privacy Information Center, \u201cEPIC - Carpenter v.

In the former, the Court held that telephone calling records are not protected under the Fourth Amendment, and in the latter, the Court held that bank records are not protected either. However, the Court has reasoned that if the service provider is merely an intermediary of communication rather than the recipient then the third party doctrine is not extended to that type of information (e.g. emails).

United States the 6th circuit decided that CSLI data was not intermediary information and was therefore not protected under the Fourth Amendment whereas the Supreme Court reversed that decision.", ""], ["        The act under which CSLI was initially seized in Carpenter v. United States, called the Stored Communications Act, defines how information can be taken from third party internet service providers (ISP).

United States, the Supreme Court classified CSLI as a type of information that almost always needs a warrant to be seized.", ""], ["Carpenter v. United States stands apart from similar cases regarding privacy and the Fourth Amendment because it addresses a technology that is essentially universal in its prevalence: cell phones. The Supreme Court is no stranger to Fourth Amendment privacy cases. In United States v. Knotts[18]", "[18] \u201cUnited States v.

Karo,\u201d Oyez (Oyez), accessed March 5, 2020, https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/83-850)"], [" the Court affirmed that it is not in violation of the Fourth Amendment to plant tracking devices on items prior to the suspected individual receiving them. While this is still tracking, it is not invasive. It consists of tracking an individual through an intermediary instead of directly tracking them. In United States v. Knotts the police planted a tracker on a container of chloroform that Knotts was set to receive. The Court argued unanimously that since the tracker only tracked Knotts\u2019 vehicle, the privacy of his home was not invaded. Additionally, they argued that the police could have achieved the same conclusion visually and that the tracker was merely an aide to that end. The conclusion from these cases is that the government may indirectly track anyone in public places. While this extent of power may seem disturbing, the Court decided in United States v. Jones that directly planting a tracking device on someone\u2019s vehicle constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Asserting that the government cannot directly track an individual using GPS, yet they can track their public movements through an intermediary leaves significant grey area in the breadth of the government\u2019s powers to warrantlessly track individuals. One of the major reasons that Carpenter v. United States is important is because it clarifies this grey area. Carpenter v. United States affirms the right to individuals to not be tracked through CSLI at any time, or have their movements traced back within a 5 year period, without a warrant (in all but the most extreme cases). In today's technologically advanced climate, large companies such as Facebook, Google, and internet service providers control a wealth of information about almost every single person in the US who utilize their technologies to simply participate in modern society. The government, legitimately or otherwise, holds the power to force these companies to turn over extremely personal information, such as communication or location information, as they have done in the past. Jewel v. NSA is a case that was initially filed nearly 12 years ago in 2008 that aimed to stop the NSA\u2019s dragnet surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans. Even after the declarations of multiple whistleblowers, government reports exposed by the Guardian and the Washington Post, and a confession by the government, the case still remains unfinished as the courts have refused to hear developments in the case for almost 5 years.[20]", "[20] Matthew Guariglia et al., \u201cJewel v.
