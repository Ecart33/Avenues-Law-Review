Digital Privacy after Carpenter v. US




As technology expands at an unprecedented rate, the law struggles to keep pace. The past 20 years have brought such influential and controversial technologies such as GPS, where the modern system developed by the Department of Defense was completed in 1993[1] and only in 2000[2] did former president Bill Clinton make GPS available to civilians with the same accuracy the military enjoyed. However, the most revolutionizing of all recent technologies is the advent and widespread adoption of cell phones. The powerful benefits of these technologies also come with very serious concerns at many levels. One of the most pervasive issues is the newfound power of the government to infringe upon individuals’ privacy rights and violate their Fourth Amendment at an unprecedented scale by utilizing various tracking technologies that most civilians are completely unaware of. Carpenter v. United States is a landmark case for defining the limits of unwarranted government surveillance in the context of modern technology, which has become so ingrained in our daily life that society would not function without it. Carpenter v. United States has cemented some basic privacy rights and acts as a declaration from the Supreme Court that intimately personal features of modern technology are a protected right.
        A federal jury convicted Carpenter of with “six counts including aiding and abetting robbery that affected interstate commerce—a violation of the Hobbs Act—and aiding and abetting the use or carriage of a firearm during a federal crime of violence”[3] between 2010 and 2012. During the litigation process of Carpenter v. United States in April 2011, two magistrate judges granted the FBI’s request to cell phone carrier information under the Stored Communications Act (SCA): "The first order sought 152 days of cell-site records from MetroPCS, which produced records spanning 127 days. The second order requested seven days of cell site location information (CSLI) from Sprint, which produced two days of records covering the period when Carpenter’s phone was “roaming” in northeastern Ohio. Altogether, the Government obtained 12,898 location points cataloging Carpenter’s movements—an average of 101 data points per day.”[4] Using this tracking information, as well as outgoing and incoming call information, the government was able to convict Carpenter: “[FBI agent Christopher] Hess used MetroPCS call detail records, for example, to show that Carpenter was within that proximity of a Detroit Radio Shack that was robbed around 10:35 a.m. on December 13, 2010. [...] Hess provided similar analysis concerning the locations of Carpenter’s and Sanders’s phones at the time of a December 18, 2010 robbery in Detroit; a March 4, 2011 robbery in Warren, Ohio; and an April 5, 2011 robbery in Detroit.”[5] Afterwards “The district court sentenced him [Carpenter] to more than 100 years in prison, and he appealed.”[6] Carpenter appealed on the grounds that the cell phone data used as evidence by the district court was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the standards set forth in the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d)[7]. In the United States Court of Appeals for The Sixth Circuit, the court ruled that “the Supreme Court has long recognized a distinction between the content of a communication and the information necessary to convey it. Content, per this distinction, is protected under the Fourth Amendment, but routing information is not”. The court also stated that GPS tracking was much more accurate than the CSLI and therefore the government's collection of information was not a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.[8] It was ruled that under the third party doctrine that Carpenter had no reasonable expectation of privacy because he had shared information with his wireless carriers. However, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower courts, holding that “Allowing government access to cell-site records—which “hold for many Americans the ‘privacies of life,’ ” Riley v. California, 573 U. S. ___, ___—contravenes that expectation [of privacy].”[9] The court neglected to extend the third party doctrine to CSLI because they stated that since “cell phones and the services they provide are ‘such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life’ that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern society,”[10] and therefore, cell phone data did not qualify as voluntarily giving information to a third party. The Supreme Court affirmed, “A warrant is required only in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party”[11] but that “the Government will generally need a warrant to access CSLI, case-specific exceptions—e.g., exigent circumstances—may support a warrantless search.”[12]
        Cell site location information, or CSLI, is a way to track a cell phone. It refers to reconstring location data based on proximity to cell towers. With information from multiple cell towers, a process called triangulation can be used to achieve greater precision. While not as precise as GPS, which can track a signal to a range of between 5 and 10 feet, CSLI information is stored by internet service providers for up to 5 years and can also include current real-time data, making it very sensitive information to access.[13] 
        In Katz v. United States in 1967, the court proclaimed, “[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.”[14] This  means “that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties” and is known as the “third-party doctrine.”[15] The types of cases where the third party doctrine is used fall into two categories: first a case where the information given to someone else carries no expectation that it will not be disclosed to the police, and second where business records or data generated from business records given to a third party are not considered information protected by the Fourth Amendment.[16] The latter is the type of case the Carpenter v. United States belongs to. The two most prominent cases involving this type of third party doctrine justification are Smith v. Maryland and United States v. Miller. In the former, the Court held that telephone calling records are not protected under the Fourth Amendment, and in the latter, the Court held that bank records are not protected either. However, the Court has reasoned that if the service provider is merely an intermediary of communication rather than the recipient then the third party doctrine is not extended to that type of information (e.g. emails). In the case of Carpenter v. United States the 6th circuit decided that CSLI data was not intermediary information and was therefore not protected under the Fourth Amendment whereas the Supreme Court reversed that decision.
        The act under which CSLI was initially seized in Carpenter v. United States, called the Stored Communications Act, defines how information can be taken from third party internet service providers (ISP). The act states that “A court order for disclosure under subsection (b) or (c) may be issued by any court that is a court of competent jurisdiction and shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.”[17] However, in Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court classified CSLI as a type of information that almost always needs a warrant to be seized.
Carpenter v. United States stands apart from similar cases regarding privacy and the Fourth Amendment because it addresses a technology that is essentially universal in its prevalence: cell phones. The Supreme Court is no stranger to Fourth Amendment privacy cases. In United States v. Knotts[18] and United States v. Karo,[19] the Court affirmed that it is not in violation of the Fourth Amendment to plant tracking devices on items prior to the suspected individual receiving them. While this is still tracking, it is not invasive. It consists of tracking an individual through an intermediary instead of directly tracking them. In United States v. Knotts the police planted a tracker on a container of chloroform that Knotts was set to receive. The Court argued unanimously that since the tracker only tracked Knotts’ vehicle, the privacy of his home was not invaded. Additionally, they argued that the police could have achieved the same conclusion visually and that the tracker was merely an aide to that end. The conclusion from these cases is that the government may indirectly track anyone in public places. While this extent of power may seem disturbing, the Court decided in United States v. Jones that directly planting a tracking device on someone’s vehicle constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Asserting that the government cannot directly track an individual using GPS, yet they can track their public movements through an intermediary leaves significant grey area in the breadth of the government’s powers to warrantlessly track individuals. One of the major reasons that Carpenter v. United States is important is because it clarifies this grey area. Carpenter v. United States affirms the right to individuals to not be tracked through CSLI at any time, or have their movements traced back within a 5 year period, without a warrant (in all but the most extreme cases). In today's technologically advanced climate, large companies such as Facebook, Google, and internet service providers control a wealth of information about almost every single person in the US who utilize their technologies to simply participate in modern society. The government, legitimately or otherwise, holds the power to force these companies to turn over extremely personal information, such as communication or location information, as they have done in the past. Jewel v. NSA is a case that was initially filed nearly 12 years ago in 2008 that aimed to stop the NSA’s dragnet surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans. Even after the declarations of multiple whistleblowers, government reports exposed by the Guardian and the Washington Post, and a confession by the government, the case still remains unfinished as the courts have refused to hear developments in the case for almost 5 years.[20] Cases such as these further confirm the weight of Carpenter v. United States. In a time where giving up personal and private information to private corporations is essential to daily life and involuntary, Carpenter v. United States declared that the American people may not be exploited by the government through indirect means. While the narrow verdict of Carpenter v. United States is far from a comprehensive description of the limitations of the government, it is a step in the right direction - a direction where privacy rights are starting to take center stage and the third party doctrine is beginning to be rolled back. It represents the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment to protect the American people to the extent that it was intended to.
Privacy is a right protected by the Fourth Amendment, yet it has been trodden on for many years, especially in our digital age, due to vagueness surrounding the actual meaning of the term. The court’s admission that location data shared with internet service providers—CSLI—is protected by the Fourth Amendment provides much needed clarity to the ambiguity of privacy in digital data. While far from perfect, Carpenter v. United States demonstrates the Supreme Court applying the Fourth Amendment to the mass droves of private information recorded by private institutions in order to protect the rights of the people against the government.
